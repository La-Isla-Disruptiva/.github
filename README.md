# La Isla Disruptiva

We live in a changing world. A world that change rapidly, a world that change profondly. 
One of the reason for the deepness of today's changes, is that we begin to master digital technologies.

La Isla Disruptiva is a program, a group and/or a practical philosophy for digital entrepreneurs that want to master these changes and take part to the construction of our digital world. To take part to the emerging of our human futur.

## Radical changes do not randomly coming from nowhere

Sure, great innovators do rarely anticipate the scale and impact of their revolutionary product. 
They dream about it and often they spend their entire life, energy and fortune dedicated to it.
But most of the time, they fail. Maybe that's the cruelty of the life... 
is there a divine justice to reward the pioneers? 
Well, we hope that they enjoyed their creative life because it
do always have a return in terms of wealth.

But we know today (broadly) how it works. Some product can have great impact and for others it's just impossible. 

 <--->  Product  <--->  Needs  <--->  Usages  <--->

To be adopted, your poduct have to be useful. It must satisfy the need of someone.

Your app or you web service can be nice and use cutting edge rocket technology, nobody cares if its useless! 

If its useful, you're ... maybe(!) in businesss. But if its only a shinier copy that another product, your fighting for the same market than your concurrent. 

Ok then... your worked hard, used innovation driven methodologies and invented something great that allows people to change their daily behavior.
Maybe you incressed their productivity and whathever.
But your market may be even smaller with an unknown, weird and nerdy gadget to sell.

All your failures are not random. 
It just didn't resonate with social patterns to create a new collective behavior. 

## Social behaviors are the disruptive targets

That may not be dramatic. Most products bring values to actual needs and are perfectly well adapted to the dominant social patterns.

Nevertheless, recent years have showned that digital products can
have dramatic consequences on collective behaviors. Google changed our access to
the information. Facebook changed the way we socialize. Tinder changed the way we
'consume' love. Uber challenged our relation to work in the transportation and then in the delivery industry. Airbnb lowered the barriers to access to the hotel business. And those are only few of the many radical company that achieved somehow to profoundly change our world in the last one and a half decades.

These company do not propose better products. They do not propose appealing new products...
These company simply offer us new social rules.

Most of the time, its not a great change for individuals. More often that not, it ease our life or distract us in a funny way. But, at he same time, it have tremendous social impacts.

## A disruptive program tou shape the world your way

As any one else, we do not know what will be the next game changing product to reach the market.
But we know one that it will be a digital product and that it will profoundly change the way individuals and organisations interact.

That's why we propose a program that focus on those 2 core ingredients to radical disruption.
